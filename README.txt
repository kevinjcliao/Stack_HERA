Your lab assignment should provide instructions on running and debugging HERA programs.
Essentially, you should use the steps for C++ debugging, with extra steps to make the debugger
	* stop at the start of your HERA_main rather than the HERA-C main,
	* show you your HERA registers and not the registers of the computer running the HERA-C system.
